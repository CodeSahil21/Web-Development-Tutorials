# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Certainly! Let’s dive into each line of your code:

<!-- Import Statement:
JavaScript

import { useState } from 'react'

This line imports the useState hook from the react library. The useState hook is a fundamental part of React that allows you to manage state within functional components.
Functional Component:
JavaScript

function App() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    {
      title: "Go to gym",
      description: "Go to gym from 7 to 9",
      completed: false
    },
    {
      title: "Study DSA",
      description: "study DSA from 9-100",
      completed: true
    }
  ]);

This defines a functional component named App.
Inside the component, you’re using the useState hook to initialize a state variable called todos.
The initial value of todos is an array containing two objects, each representing a “todo” item. Each object has properties like title, description, and completed.
Add Todo Function:
JavaScript

function addTodo() {
  setTodos([...todos, {
    title: "new Todo",
    description: "description of new todo"
  }]);
}

This function, addTodo, adds a new todo item to the todos array.
It uses the setTodos function (provided by the useState hook) to update the state. The new state includes the existing todos array (spread using ...todos) and an additional object with the specified title and description.
Render Section:
JavaScript

return (
  <div>
    <button onClick={addTodo}>Add a random todo</button>
    {todos.map(function (todo) {
      return <Todo title={todo.title} description={todo.description} />
    })}
  </div>
)

This JSX (JavaScript XML) is returned by the App component.
It renders:
A button with an onClick event handler that triggers the addTodo function when clicked.
A mapping over the todos array, rendering a Todo component for each item. The title and description properties of each todo are passed as props to the Todo component.
Todo Component:
JavaScript

function Todo(props) {
  function onclickHandler() {
    // Add any logic here
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <h2>{props.description}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
This defines another functional component named Todo.
It receives props (which include title and description) and renders them as headings (<h1> and <h2>).
Export:
JavaScript

export default App;
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
This exports the App component as the default export of this module.
Remember to replace {todos.title} and {todos.description} with {todo.title} and {todo.description} inside the map function in your render section. You want to access the properties of each individual todo item.
